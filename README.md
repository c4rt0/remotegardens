Remote garden solution based on micro-controllers (remotegardens.com) 

Many years ago I came up with an idea of completely automatic grow system for various types of plants. Inspired by "The Martian" played by Matt Damon I thought of creating sort of independent plant environment controlled by machines. These days traditional agriculture accounts for, on average, 70 percent of all water withdrawals globally... hydroponics and aeroponics can be organic and solves this problem!
